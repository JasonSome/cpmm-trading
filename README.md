## Overview

AMM code base blah blah blah (eventually should write something here)...

## Installation

Insert something here at one point?

## Usage

The files are organized using the below directory structure. To run the notebooks you will need to include the src/ and data/ files in the same directory as the notebook.

(I will clean this up so that everything can run directly if it is organized locally in the same way that it is here.)

## Directory Structure

The main python code files are located in the src/ directory.
The Jupyter notebooks are located in the notebooks/ directory. 
The files needed to run the simulation on the HPC cluster are located in the hpc_files/ directory.
The simulation output files are currently stored in the data/ directory.
