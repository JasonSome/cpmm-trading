### Running the code on Ginsburg

## Logging In

Open up a terminal instance and type

ssh <user>@burg.rcs.columbia.edu

When prompted type in your password and hit enter

## Navigation

When you log in you will be in a log in node. They request that we do not run anything directly on this node. There are a few basic commands:

ls: displays what is in the current directory

cd <directory>: navigates to the chosen directory

cd ..: moves back one step in the directory tree

mkdir <foldername>: makes a directory

rm <file>: deletes a file or directory

exit: ends the session on Ginsburg

## Text editing

nano <filename>: opens up a simple text editor. If the file does not exist, it creates one. You can navigate the lines using the arrow keys.
                 To write the file press ctrl + O. To exit the nano session press ctrl + X. Other functionality is given at the bottom of the nano 
                 window.
