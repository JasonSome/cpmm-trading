# Empirical Analysis

All the data used for Section 5 of the paper can be found in the "data" folder. In particular, data/dune contains the reserves of the considered Uniswap v2 pool through January 2025.

Figure 14 as well as the corresponding parameters can be obtained by running the hist_dist_2025-01 notebook. 

Figure 15 is obtained by first running the notebooks Run_AMM_Sim_Notebook and Run_AMM_Sim_Notebook_HIST, and then the notebook Read_AMM_Data_v2 (other Figures, not shown in the paper, are also available through this notebook, as well as the one entitled Read_AMM_Data_v2_HIST).

Figures 16 and 17 can be obtained thanks to the notebook AMM_hist_ETHUSDC_2025-01, while Figures 18 and 19 are obtained thanks to AMM_hist_ETHUSDC_2025-01_optimal.
